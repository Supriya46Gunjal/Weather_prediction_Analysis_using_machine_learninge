# Weather_prediction_Analysis_using_machine_learninge

This project aims to predict weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation, using machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and others. By leveraging historical weather data, the models are trained to forecast future weather trends with improved accuracy.

The project involves data collection, cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering to optimize model performance. After training, the models are evaluated using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² to ensure reliable predictions. Visualizations help compare predicted weather trends with actual data, providing insights for decision-making in agriculture, logistics, and disaster management.
